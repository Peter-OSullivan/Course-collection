This is a version of the traditional Hangman game containing 2000 dictionary words, with no categories or help.

Difficulty changes with lenght of words used.

Also some words are obscure since no effort was taken to filter types of words in use beyond simply what is in the English dictionary.

Testing was limited so cannot guarantee that sounds work on all platform iterations although it works fine on my phone,(my first proper mobile App).
Prototype was built in AppInventor2.
Final App built in Xamarin / visual studio 2015.
